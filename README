          my ($self,$value) = @_;
          $self->divert( $value ? "yes" : "no" );
        }

        package main;

        my $flow = Acme::Flowchart::Conditional->new;
        $flow->hook("yes", sub { print "Yes"; });
        $flow->hook("no", sub { print "No"; });
        $flow->flow(1); # Prints "Yes";
        $flow->flow(0); # Prints "No";
