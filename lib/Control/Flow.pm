=head1 SYNOPSIS

Constructs a flowchart of operations for flowchart-based programming.

    package Acme::Flowchart::Conditional;
    use Moose;
        with 'Control::Flow';
    
    sub flow {
      my ($self,$value) = @_;
      $self->divert( $value ? "yes" : "no" );
    }

    package main;
    
    my $flow = Acme::Flowchart::Conditional->new;
    $flow->hook("yes", sub { print "Yes"; });
    $flow->hook("no", sub { print "No"; });
    $flow->flow(1); # Prints "Yes";
    $flow->flow(0); # Prints "No";

=head1 WHY?

Flowchart based programming is starting to get interesting. This modules
provides a ground for experimentation. There's more to it than meets the eye.
